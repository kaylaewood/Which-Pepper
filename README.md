### About
* Which Pepper is a two player matching card game.
* Players will enter their names on the first page.
* Then, players will be able to read the game rules.
* After players click "play game," player 1 will be prompted to start their round.
* Player 1 will then flip cards over in hopes of finding matches as quickly as possible.
* Once player 1 has found all matches, their time will be logged in local storage and player 2 will repeat the process.
* Once player 2 has completed their round, the player with the best time will be congratulated on the last page, with both times appearing. 
* Players can then click "new game" and start all over or "rematch" and got back to the game board as the same players.

  * semantic HTML
  * DRY JavaScript
  * localStorage to persist data
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Match/recreate a UI and create a great UX
